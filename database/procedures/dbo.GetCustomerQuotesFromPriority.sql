    Takes an optional @SelectedCustomerId: the branch the caller chose, for a contact whose e-mail
    address serves more than one customer. 3,684 addresses do - davide@iscar.co.il covers 22 ישקר
    sites, sharbaf_o@mac.org.il covers 25 מכבי branches.

    Without it, the customer is resolved as before: the lowest CustomerContactId for that address.
    That is stable but arbitrary, and it can land on a branch holding nothing while another of the
    caller's own branches holds their devices.

    THE ID IS VERIFIED, NOT TRUSTED. It is used only when the caller really is a contact of that
    customer; anything else falls through to the original pick. Passing a customer the caller does
    not serve returns their own data, never the other customer's - checked against a customer with
    71 order lines, which returned nothing.
